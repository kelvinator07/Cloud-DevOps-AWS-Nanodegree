RDS Databases 

Choosing a database
AWS Aurora and MySQL have no additional licensing costs. Microsoft SQL Server will have additional licensing costs.

A single RDS Server can host multiple databases
Note that you can use a single RDS database that hosts multiple applications, each with different logins and users for those applications. In other words, you donâ€™t need to create a separate RDS service for each application.



S3 bucket
Choose a DNS compliant name for the S3 bucket.
Command line arguments
aws s3 ls <link to S3 bucket>
This line above lists files in the S3 bucket.

aws s3 cp <file name> <link to S3 bucket>  
This line above copies a file from your local machine to the S3 bucket.

Key Points
S3 can be used to store your config files, media or log files.
Your servers don't need credentials to access S3 provided they have a role assigned.
We recommend you choose RDS as opposed to installing a database in your own servers that you have to manage and back up yourself.
